      <![CDATA[ <p>Birdman v Catwoman with Comcastro Blogger Daniel Smith Comcastro blogger Daniel Smith leads a conversation reflecting on all of the super heroes in present times. He leans heavily on today's comic book explosion and transitions into the treatment of veterans, the most fan-engaging celebrities of Dragoncon, the personality cult of Coach Paul Johnson, and the arrival of the Atlanta Hawks. The conversation goes everywhere: from controversy in sports to the cost of being at the top, to politics, the Mcconaissance, football vs rugby, independent film, the return of Shaq-Fu, career reinvention, constitutional law, the bipolar history of comic book adaptation, and the epic triumphs and failures of comic books in film. Daniel is the greatest of all superfans. Nerds of the world, this one's for you.</p> ]]>

      <![CDATA[ <p>Alternate Reality Game Design with Startup ARchimeral Comcastrodors, please welcome April Arrglington and Jose Delgado from ARchimeral, a gaming startup in Atlanta. April and JD shared with us details about their upcoming project "The Age of Turing," an alternate reality game that asks how the present would be different had computer science visionary Alan Turing thrived after WWII rather than facing the tragic end he experienced. Here we reflect on Turing's life and accomplishments, ponder the potential of artificial intelligence, explore the challenges faced by the autistic, and debate the merits of science fiction. April and JD describe the remaining characters in the game and detail the dystopian universe that they created to serve as the backdrop for game play. Reflecting on the intersection of society and technology, we also discuss how the game seeks to make these structures known to the general public.

      <![CDATA[ <p>How to Build a Virtual Reality Empire with ATLvr In this surprisingly engaging interview we introduce ATLvr and their upcoming Virtual Runway. Peter Stolmeier, Annie Eaton, and Jacob Lance walk Maximüs Groves and guest host Matthew Queen through all the recent developments in virtual reality, talk about their virtual reality fashion show, and answer tough questions on the future of humanity as VR reaches maturity. These guys are true believers and they share with us some of their personal fantasies for the platform as we ponder the cultural impact. During the second half of the interview, Max and Matt try to stretch their creativity and all we hear in response is either, "We can't talk about it," or, "It's HAPPENING!" - cue lasers and Ron Paul hand motions.... We get the full details on what's coming, plan for a future virtual reality podcast, and reflect on other issues like women in technology, awesome last words, and the whereabouts of Julian Assange. Also, there's an argument about a Tijuana pony show.</p> ]]>

      <![CDATA[ <p>How Game Design Evolved into an Art Form with Andrew Greenberg Today on the Comcastro podcast, Maximüs Groves and guest host Matthew Queen talk with Andrew Greenberg, President of the Georgia Game Developers Association, member of the Joseph Campbell Foundation, helped to found the Mythic Imagination Institute, and is co-chair of the Mythic Journeys convention. Greenberg, a game designer of tabletop role-playing games and role-playing video games, was one of White Wolf Publishing's original game developers for Vampire: The Masquerade and has worked on such titles as Mall Tycoon, Fading Suns, Dracula Unleashed, and Rapture: The Second Coming. Over the course of two hours, we speculate with Andrew on the state of the gaming industry, debate the virtues of gaming, and reflect on the evolution of the art form. The conversation turns to military applications, cognitive effect, the legacy of Street Fighter, and the power of myth.</p> ]]>

In this episode, Howard talks to our host Maximüs Groves about getting the Pope on the phone to solve our energy crisis, about the importance of the development of space based solar power, planetary missions, space manufacturing, and the repurposing of carbon dioxide. From accidentally starting the Sixties to living in a state of constant climate change and even contemplating the emerging compassion of Western culture, there is a universe of big ideas we are responsible for bringing to bear – and no stone is left unturned. Also, get ready for the best wingman story you’ve ever heard. aerospace industry, climate change, climate stabilization, energy crisis, genius of the beast, how I accidentally started the sixties, howard bloom, lucifer principle, mohammed code, omnology, philosophy, religion, space based solar power, space development steering committee, space economy, space infrastructure, space solar power, western culture&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
