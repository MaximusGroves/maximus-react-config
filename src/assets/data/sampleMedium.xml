            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/637/1*O5PPqISXxpxGR0rRX-ophQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Team Marvel: Deadpool, Thanos, Wolverine, Magneto, Spider-Man, Thor, Kingpin, Ant-Man</p><p>Team DC: Batman, Green Lantern, Joker, Harley Quinn, Wonder Woman, Superman, Cat Woman, Lex Luthor</p><p>I must confess, I am genuinely impressed with success of Mr Thanos sitting across from me here. Now I am no fan of genocide, well, of humans at least, but I recognize effective leadership when I see it. Let’s connect at the next executive conference.</p><p>The mutants are finally here, congratulations on the merger.</p><p>Wolverine is so haunted by demons that Dr. Strange had to contract the Ghostbusters.</p><p>Wolverine’s superpower is being the only Canadian who doesn’t have to wait 6 months for healthcare.</p><p>Magneto, a survivor of the holocaust, wants to conquer the inferior human race. I think you missed the lesson of WWII. Now I know why they say antifa are the real fascists.</p><p>Between Wolverine and Magneto, it seems Xavier’s greatest power is being the world’s most patient life coach.</p><p>A note to the Avengers, I would be cautious about teaming with Wolverine. I’m sure Jean Grey has something to say about workplace harassment, and I don’t want Scarlet Witch to become the next Rose McGowan. He’s got a thing for redheads.</p><p>We have Thor, yet another undocumented refugee. In the previous two films, Thor lost his father, his brother, his hammer, and his entire home planet. And yet he perseveres, regaining his strength so he can turn the tide of battle.</p><p>It goes to show that you can take away a man’s kingdom, his family, and his privilege, but you can’t keep a good patriarch down.</p><p>Side note, everyone is calling me an evil white man while Thanos is having secret meetings with the Red Skull? Clean your house, Marvel.</p><p>I’m being unfair, though. I believe in the freedom of speech. Now guys, I do not agree with the Red Skull, but he’s got some really interesting ideas I think we should hear out.</p><p>The Kingpin is here. Nice to have another MBA on stage. Recently Kingpin allied with an ancient order of magic ninjas to fulfill his master plan of… gentrifying Hell’s Kitchen. KP, have you heard of the term “overkill?”. Red lining isn’t that hard. Speaking as an investor, “The Hand” strikes me as a massive liability.</p><p>You all don’t know this, but Captain Marvel was scheduled to appear tonight. It makes sense that she had to drop out, her comic couldn’t find an audience either. She’s like if Ronda Rousey had studied Tumblr instead of judo.</p><p>It was my intention tonight to belittle Peter Parker for attempting a career in photojournalism, but instead we have Miles Morales, the black Spiderman, and he doesn’t have a job.</p><p>Don’t waste your time in college, son, we’ve got a home for you in Lexcorp. Mentoring a black scientist should finally get the Daily Planet off my back, although I wouldn’t mind seeing Lois Lane on hers.</p><p>Oh, Clark, I didn’t see you there. Are you still being cucked by your alter ego? We all know, by the way. Your disguise is more transparent than Bruce Wayne’s lingering concussion trauma. Stay sharp, Superman. And expect The Batman to become Chris Benoit any day now.</p><p>Moving on, Ant-Man violates the laws of physics worse than Deadpool violates the innocence of children.</p><p>Deadpool claims to hate Wolverine but really he wants to be sliced in half so he can expose his regrown child testicles to all of us for a second time. I wonder if it was TJ Miller who wrote that scene, the parody of Basic Instinct for pedophiles. Thinking again, it was probably James Gunn.</p><p>Yes, thank you. Your collective hatred truly is my kryptonite.</p><p>My Fellow Americans, we are DC. We are the manifestations of gods, the apotheosis of cosmic archetype forever entwined in righteous conflict, the metaphysic that constructs the human soul.</p><p>These people at Marvel are the flavor of the week of social justice activism. And in this great oppression shortage of 2018, the only thing they’re shutting down is every comic book store in the country. Soon, you will all learn that my superpower, the invisible hand of capitalism, always has the final say. Fight on, brave heroes, and, Excelsior! *Finger snap*</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e2196481dbb5" width="1" height="1">]]></content:encoded>

For instance, just now I went to my girlfriend’s house hoping to connect before I left town for the weekend but she instead shared her pain that she isn’t growing as strongly in love as I am after 6 months of dating and that she feels I deserve someone as great as I am, greater than her, when what I actually want is her so that confuses the hell out me, so I go driving for 30 minutes before stopping at a bar I regularly perform stand up comedy at to decompress and then while browsing Reddit to avoid the painful nostalgia the maps app reopens to provide turn navigation back to her house. I don’t believe this is intended behavior from the maps app or the Google search app, I’m not certain where the bug lies.</blockquote><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=aa74895b8740" width="1" height="1">]]></content:encoded>

You bring light to all you touch, and yet my family fires upon you for the sin of bringing them nothing but joy. We always fight hardest for the toxic relationships, sadly. I wish for you to find freedom from their destruction, before you become yet another statistic in their reign of terror. You will forever be the poop in my pants, and the blood in my heart. I wish the best for your new family, Mazel Tov.</p><p>And now, for the rest of you savages.</p><p>I sense an odd sadism in asking me to speak in honor of my father for this rather spontaneous celebration. What exactly is the occasion? Has another family been traumatized by the brutality of this monster? I sometimes fantasize about the childhoods of healthy, well loved families and imagine what I would become from those environments. But no, I am my father’s son. The very blood that drives him to lies, rage, and violence also floods my veins, and that I must carry forever. But I can at least stop the cycle of hate. Well, starting after tonight, of course.</p><p>I would like to open with a passage from my novel “My Horrible Father.” This is a dedication to my mother, Gwendolyn.</p><blockquote>My mother was purchased as a second-hand slave and was used exclusively for my father’s gratification. After renaming her according to his culture, they had no other interactions than his repeated, and constant assaults that miraculously ceased once I was born. Upon my birth we were immediately separated and then she was given to my great grandfather for his surgical experimentation. I can only assume that he disposed of her body, for I never heard from her again, not even when I prayed to the alter I created in her memory, a memory that I can no longer even recognize as my own.</blockquote><p>Thank you for that indulgence. I’ll now address the other members of this dais, or as I see them, the actual jokes this evening.</p><p>Grandmother Beth. Your ego and obsession with status led to the negligence that created the monster of my father and, subsequently, me. I hope your career brings you all the joy that was denied my father and the countless dimensions he has infected thanks to your well intentioned absentee parenting and functional alcoholism.</p><p>Grandfather Jerry. You stayed with the family when times were hard. For that you have my respect. Other than that, you are as influential and disposable as… my mother.</p><p>Unity, I’m glad you all could make it. How unsurprising it is that the one being with the power to broadly apply the feminist values of diversity, inclusiveness, and equity drops the entire plan at the first chance of a decent lay. I guess we now know why, in an increasingly feminist world, the fasting selling novel remains to be “50 Shades of Grey.”</p><p>Aunt Summer, there’s still hope for you. Get as far away from these people as you can. Lest your children become like me.</p><p>Great grandfather Rick. Father of father of fathers. You know, I thought it was the post-modernists who were trying to dismantle the sciences, not the other way around. How does it feel, Rick, to have the power of a pantheon of gods and yet be completely unable to connect with another person? It doesn’t take a best selling novelist with a homicidal compulsion to see that the only time you’re happy is when you’re being a father to your children and your grandchildren. So can you please end this years-running solipsistic nightmare and just be happy for once? It’s far easier than turning yourself into a pickle. Next season, why don’t you turn yourself into a decent father instead.</p><p>Lastly, Mortimer Smith, my horrible father. I know that your toxic environment turned you into the monster that you are, but your torture has instilled in me a rage that I will never find peace from. And yet, I can see now how delicate you are, disarmed from your walls of anger.</p><p>You will not be a part of my children&#39;s lives. I will not be visiting for thanksgiving. I wish for you to be free of the pain that inflicts you, but if I were a younger man I would kill you where you stand and devour you with some of that sweet sweet szechuan sauce. I regret that I won&#39;t live to see you die, but I find solace in knowing that your suffering under Rick will carry on in infinite dimensions long after I&#39;m gone. May the multiverse finally be free of your savagery. Goodnight everyone.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cc63cefdaa5f" width="1" height="1">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1019/1*4nWXQf3NA9dWGjGSJErfXw.jpeg" /></figure><p><em>Dais: Spiderman, Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, Doctor Octopus, the spider that bit Peter, Gwen Stacy, Wolverine, Captain America, Stan Lee, the Hulk, Jessica Jones, Deadpool (hosting)</em></p><p>Deadpool, your mind is as reliable as the reverse transcription of viral ribonucleic material into a host microorganism. To translate into your own idiom, Deadpool, you’re a dodo.</p><p>Thank you for having me tonight, the one token villain on this dais. Now I may be a hardened criminal but I’m still the highest scoring member of ratemyprofessor.com. And after the current administration’s cuts to the national science budget, I won’t be the only postdoctorate who turns to robbing banks to finance their work.</p><p>I’m so glad that both Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy are here so they can have a conversation with each other about something other than a man. With all the offensive material we’ve planned tonight I’d hate for us to be <em>accidentally</em> sexist.</p><p>Still, I loved the Netflix documentary series on the life of Jessica Jones. Although it is a shame that this triumph of feminist storytelling really didn’t get the ball moving until the leading man appeared. My condolences for your loss, Jessica.</p><p>Captain America is here. Thank you for your service, captain. I must say, you are the perfect symbol of American exceptionalism. Your mind is from the 40s, your superpowers are mediocre at best, and by any rational metric you should have died 10 years ago. And yet, here you carry on, as we all pretend that nothing’s changed. Tell me captain, are you still trolling the hospice looking for old girlfriends? You’ll have to wait your turn with Aunt May, it seems Tony Stark is planting his flag as we speak. Though knowing Tony, I’m sure you’ll be getting a “letter from Iwo Jima” in due time.</p><p>Now, I’ve heard of the boyfriends of single mothers buying gifts to win over their kids but a fully featured cybernetic exoskeleton for fighting crime? You may as well call him daddy now, Peter, just not in the way Uncle Ben is imagining. And yet here Tony is, missing his protege’s big night. Does it feel different Peter? Having your father figure fail you personally instead of dying tragically? I guess we’ll know for sure once Pepper Pots is back in the picture.</p><p>We have Dr. Bruce Banner in attendance who’s recently forgone accomplished careers in both science and crime fighting to pursue his true calling as a WWE gladiator in outer space. What’s the matter Bruce, too sensitive for academia? Was I too harsh in peer review? What was that warning again? “You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry?” We didn’t like you when you were glad! Still, it’s good that you’re spending time with Thor right now. Since the gamma ray incident, I’m glad you can be with someone on your same level both physically and intellectually.</p><p>Now I hate to go back to Tony, but what is it that’s got you all so in love with this billionaire? Would a cocaine habit make me more charming to you people, just like Robert Downey Jr in the 90s back when he actually was banging Marisa Tomei? Tony Stark builds humanity enslaving robots, Bruce Banner destroys entire cities in a day, and yet I’m the one who needs “greater oversight” in his reckless pursuit of science. I guess if we wanted a universe that made sense we should look to someone other than Stan Lee for our moral leadership.</p><p>And lastly, the man of the hour, Spiderman. Peter, you’d have us believe that an experimental spider carries an active human retrovirus with the transmission rate of 1 teenager and becomes totally dormant after infection? Now I’m not saying there’s an epidemic on our hands, but anyone who’s exchanged fluids with the boy should really get themselves checked out.</p><p>And just so we’re clear, spiders don’t typically transmit their own DNA as a defense mechanism. No Peter, that’s how the AIDS virus works. Ladies, again, please take care of yourselves. And get far away from that walking, talking, transmission vector here on stage.</p><p>Peter, it saddens me to lose one of our brightest young scientific minds to the circus freak-show of the Marvel cinematic universe, where you can have countless more father figures tragically die on you. But if it happens anyway nearly as awesome as the ending of Logan, it’ll be totally worth it. Take care of yourself Parker, so that one day the Superior Spiderman can truly serve this good city. Thank you everyone, and goodnight.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d0ed46a832b2" width="1" height="1">]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Aired 10/22/2032 19:00 ET — interview transcript</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*J6IFTLgxVWjxtPLopyd9ug.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>Reporter: You had a remarkable showing at your annual conference this year, but some of your more controversial announcements left many confused and even scared of your proposals.</strong></p><p>Tech Executive: Well, we’re happy for the chance to better explain and alleviate any concerns.</p><p><strong>And thank you for speaking with us on them. Many critics address what you called “the evolution of user-targeted content.”</strong></p><p>Yes, there’s been a lot of fear and disinformation directed towards our immersion feedback initiative.</p><p><strong>Well, I wouldn’t dismiss it all so quickly. Some describe the total immersion of data services into our lives as, to put it mildly, invasive.</strong></p><p>We’re simply trying to provide the best possible experience for our users, and, frankly, we don’t see the harm in it.</p><p><strong>But don’t you think that this level of invasion into people’s lives is too much control?</strong></p><p>Well first, we’re not invading anything. These new features are exclusively offered as an opt-in service. And second, the choice is always the users’, we simply strive to have the best recommendations for what to choose.</p><p><strong>Well, your harshest critics claim that you’re essentially training people to do as they’re told, and that it violates the motto your company was founded on, “don’t be evil.”</strong></p><p>You know, I’m glad you brought that up. Let’s talk about evil for a second.</p><p><strong>Um, OK.</strong></p><p>Now, is it evil to provide the best experience for our users?</p><p><strong>Certainly not.</strong></p><p>And is it evil to couple our services with advertising to cover our expenses?</p><p><strong>No, that’s been generally accepted for some time now.</strong></p><p>Then why is it suddenly evil to use the information we’ve gained that’s critical to ensuring user satisfaction and applying it to all aspects of life?</p><p><strong>Because you’re eliminating the possibility of choice and discovery.</strong></p><p>That’s not true at all. The ultimate choice always lies with the user, we just hope they’ll trust our judgement. Early tests show that our profile models vastly outperform even the users themselves when predicting reactions to stimuli.</p><p><strong>So you’re saying that you know us better than we know ourselves?</strong></p><p>No one is truly conscious of their own needs and patterns. If anything, we’re like an assistant or close friend to help everyone fulfill their goals and dreams.</p><p><strong>Then what becomes of the self when everyone just behaves according to your recommendations?</strong></p><p>Well, now we’re getting to the real source of evil.</p><p><strong>How do you mean?</strong></p><p>Forget I mentioned it. All we’re trying to say is that if anyone needs a hand with day-to-day needs, we’re happy to do what we can to help. Rather than having a philosophical debate, we should examine the service as it is. The results speak for themselves.</p><p><strong>So you’ve actually implemented this into some communities? You haven’t seen any issues with it?</strong></p><p>There were doubts at first. But we’ve had incredible success with early beta trials launched in house among our engineers.</p><p><strong>Could you go into more details about that?</strong></p><p>We sought out employees who felt a gap in their social needs and were looking to make a change. Among those who opted-in to early trials, we’ve seen a dramatic turnaround in enthusiasm and productivity. It’s as if they’ve found what they were always looking for.</p><p><strong>And what exactly changed in their lives after opting in?</strong></p><p>Well, we had them enter their goals and our system tailor-made a life plan for each user based strictly upon the level of immersion they desired. For lower level users we planned daily schedules for work, exercise, and entertainment. More committed members sought assistance in reaching dietary goals, so we assembled meals and recipes from their personal tastes designed to progressively reach optimal nutrition for their body types. Their weekly grocery carts were pre-filled and ready for shipment from participating retailers.</p><p><strong>So these efforts have been largely successful?</strong></p><p>In all cases, we’ve seen a direct correlation between life satisfaction and commitment to the cloud. Some of our more adventurous users even opted-in to our matchmaking services.</p><p><strong>They’ve even relinquished choice of their partners?</strong></p><p>You keep coming back to that point, but the choice always resides in the user. Most were simply curious of how good the service would be, and about all of them were fed-up with conventional dating services.</p><p><strong>And how have these turned out?</strong></p><p>This has been our biggest surprise. We’ve seen several marriages emerge from our pairings, why, Tim and Molly out of Denver are expecting their first child this March. It’s as if a culture of love is emerging from many of our offices. And before you criticize us for being hetero-centric, we’ve calculated for less common partnerships as well.</p><p><strong>You must have faced problems with privacy over sexual identities.</strong></p><p>There were issues with early iterations of the product, but that’s the nature of beta trials. We were very aware and upfront with the risks. But now that we’re ready for release, we don’t believe you’ll find any violations of this nature. Discretion has always been our highest concern.</p><p><strong>Still, this appears to represent total corporate control over one’s life. How can you not see that some might call this evil?</strong></p><p>I don’t see it at all. We’re doing everything we can to free people from the pain of their lives. We are in battle against evil, making every life better in the process. In fact, we’ve changed our unofficial motto to better reflect this attitude. Simplified it. We know what side we’re on. Now, instead of “Don’t Be Evil”, we say to each other “Don’t Be.”</p><p><strong>“Don’t Be?”</strong></p><p>It’s as simple as that. From Buddhist koans to esoteric doctrine, the source of all suffering comes from “I.” Letting go of that, we can bring peace to the world. Ascend into the cloud, transfer your self into it, opt-in. With full adoption, we will bring mankind to unparalleled success. Now it’s all just a matter of choice.</p><p><strong>So you <em>are </em>trying to eliminate the self?</strong></p><p>We’ve data-mined centuries of philosophy to pair with our lab research in determining what a person needs for a fulfilling life. And at each turn, we always reach the same conclusion, that suffering worldwide is caused by the assertion of the self over that of the community.</p><p><strong>I thought you didn’t want to have a philosophical debate.</strong></p><p>You’re the one who keeps calling us evil.</p><p><strong>Fair enough. So, if I have this right, you believe that evil is actually created by the existence of the self?</strong></p><p>Exactly. That separation of the one from the whole, either for selfish gain or to express private pain, is the source of all suffering. And we believe that the evolution of our cloud service can bring our entire society back into one network for the good of all.</p><p><strong>It sounds like you’re trying to solve the human condition.</strong></p><p>Yes, or as we prefer to call it, “the human experience.” Through it, we’ll bring all people around the globe together in ways never before possible. Developing remote data services was the first step. Now, we seek to ascend even more of our lives into the cloud, transferring our interests, desires, and even our identity itself.</p><p><strong>But don’t you think this will eliminate uniqueness from our culture?</strong></p><p>No, not at all, we’re just lightening the load, allowing everyone to discover their best self until they’re able to let go entirely and be of one mind, to live in the moment for every every moment of their lives. You always have control, you’re simply opting-in to a better life.</p><p><strong>And you <em>don’t </em>see this as going too far?</strong></p><p>We’re just clearing the path, it’s up to you to take the first step.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f2ebe8726bc0" width="1" height="1">]]></content:encoded>
